## 🚦 Europe's Transport Gap – Policy, Risk & Competitiveness Analysis

> A data-driven sustainability project analyzing **Germany’s transport sector** as a deep dive — within the EU context.  
> Connects CO₂ emissions trends, modal share, EV charging rollout, and policy alignment.  
> Shows how policy inertia, freight challenges & modal stagnation threaten competitiveness and climate credibility.

## 📄 About This Project

Uncovers why Germany’s transport sector:
- Misses EU climate targets despite strong industry
- Shows minimal modal shift (rail, bus, bike)
- Faces freight CO₂ bottlenecks and limited EV truck rollout
- Lags peer EU countries on policy alignment
- Needs data-based, measurable KPIs to restore credibility

Bridges **policy analysis, data science & ESG financial risk**.

## 🧠 What Makes This Project Unique

✅ Combines real datasets (UBA, Eurostat, IFEU)  
✅ Custom policy gap matrix & radar visualization  
✅ Country-level focus + EU benchmark  
✅ CO₂ tracking, modal shift, freight & infrastructure roll-out trends  
✅ Final recommendations grounded in measurable policy impact

## 📓 Notebook Overview

This Jupyter notebook brings together data analytics, ESG risk modeling, and policy evaluation:

- Loads and cleans datasets covering CO₂ emissions, modal share, charging network rollout, and policy targets
- Visualizes Germany’s emissions gap vs. climate targets
- Highlights modal share stagnation despite EU policy goals
- Plots EV charging infrastructure rollout against freight CO₂ emissions
- Builds a radar chart comparing Germany’s transport policy scores with EU targets
- Ends with conclusions and expert recommendations to bridge the performance and credibility gap

---

## 🖼️ Visuals

This project includes multiple data visualizations to make complex policy and emissions trends easier to understand:

- 📈 **CO₂ Emissions vs. Climate Target** (Line Chart) — shows the persistent emissions gap over time
- 🚗 **Modal Share Change** (Bar Chart) — compares the modal share of car, rail, bus, bike, and other modes between 2020 and 2023
- 🔌 **EV Charging Rollout vs. Freight Emissions** (Scatter Plot) — analyzes if increased charging infrastructure correlates with reduced freight CO₂ emissions
- 🕸 **Policy Gap Radar Chart** — visualizes how Germany's scores on key transport policy dimensions lag behind EU targets

---

## 🌍 Why This Matters

Transport is Germany’s largest obstacle to meeting EU and Paris Agreement climate goals.  
This analysis shows, with real data and advanced visuals, how policy gaps, slow infrastructure rollout, and limited modal shift undermine decarbonization targets.

By combining data analytics, ESG risk evaluation, and policy research, this project demonstrates how measurable insights can:
- Expose credibility gaps in green claims
- Guide policy adjustments for real-world impact
- Help investors and stakeholders track sustainable finance outcomes

It’s a live demonstration of how data-driven research can transform sustainability reporting from slogans to substance.
