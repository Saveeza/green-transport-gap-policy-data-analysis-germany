# 🌍 European Green Transport Gap & Policy Data Analysis  
A professional ESG, policy & data analytics project exploring why **Germany and peer EU countries** struggle to meet climate targets — and what it reveals about modal shift, freight bottlenecks, and competitiveness.  
Features real CO₂ data, infrastructure rollout trends, a policy gap matrix, country comparisons & expert recommendations.  
Demonstrates advanced data science, ESG risk evaluation & regulatory analysis.

## 🚦 Europe's Transport Gap – Policy, Risk & Competitiveness Analysis

> A data-driven sustainability project analyzing **Germany’s transport sector** as a deep dive — within the EU context.  
> Connects CO₂ emissions trends, modal share, EV charging rollout, and policy alignment.  
> Shows how policy inertia, freight challenges & modal stagnation threaten competitiveness and climate credibility.

## 📄 About This Project

Uncovers why Germany’s transport sector:
- Misses EU climate targets despite strong industry
- Shows minimal modal shift (rail, bus, bike)
- Faces freight CO₂ bottlenecks and limited EV truck rollout
- Lags peer EU countries on policy alignment
- Needs data-based, measurable KPIs to restore credibility

Bridges **policy analysis, data science & ESG financial risk**.

🌱 Why This Matters
Europe’s transport transition is critical for meeting climate goals & retaining industrial competitiveness.
This project shows — with real data & policy context — where Germany and its peers fall short, and how smarter modal policy & infrastructure can bridge the gap.
