## 📄 About This Project

This research-based analysis investigates:

- Germany’s rising transport emissions and policy failures  
- Lack of modal shift despite national goals  
- Freight CO₂ bottlenecks and insufficient EV truck infrastructure  
- Comparison with EU climate frameworks and peer countries  
- Recommendations to close the credibility and performance gap  

It bridges **data science**, **policy insight**, and **financial sustainability risk**.

## 🧠 What Makes This Project Unique

✅ Real-world data from verified sources (UBA, IFEU, Eurostat)  
✅ Custom-built policy gap matrix with scoring  
✅ Country-level comparison (Germany vs. EU peers)  
✅ CO₂ tracking, modal share, and infrastructure alignment  
✅ Final recommendations linked to measurable impact

## 🧪 Notebook Overview

The Jupyter notebook:

- Loads and cleans all relevant datasets  
- Visualizes CO₂ emissions vs. climate targets  
- Shows modal share stagnation with bar charts  
- Correlates EV truck charging rollout vs. freight emissions  
- Uses a radar chart to score Germany’s policy alignment  
- Finishes with professional insights & policy recommendations

## 🌍 Why This Matters

Germany’s transport sector is the largest roadblock to meeting EU climate goals. This project illustrates how poor infrastructure, inconsistent incentives, and weak modal policies lead to failure — and how data-based accountability can steer sustainable progress.  

This repo is a live demonstration of how advanced analytics and policy research can intersect to guide climate strategy.
